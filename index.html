    <h1>Honey, I shrunk the data centres: Is small the new big?</h1>

    <article>One day the mighty data centre could be toppled into obsolescence by the humble smartphone, said Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas on a recent podcast.

Speaking to host Prakhar Gupta, the AI chief argued that people will eventually use powerful, personalised AI tools that will be able to run on the hardware already inside their devices.

This will be instead of the AI relying on transmitting data to and from enormous data centres, and using remote computers to function, as is generally the case now.

Apple's AI system, Apple Intelligence, already runs some features on specialised chips inside the firm's latest range of products. The tech giant says this means that its AI tools can operate more quickly, and also keep private data more secure.

Microsoft's Copilot+ laptops also include on-device AI processing. </article>

<article> these are all premium-priced gadgets. In general, not many current devices have that capability. AI requires powerful processing that's beyond the means of standard equipment.

"It's long term 'if and when' powerful and efficient AI can run on local devices," says Jonathan Evans, director of consultancy company Total Data Centre Solutions.

The data centre industry certainly isn't shrinking in terms of demand. But is it getting smaller in other ways?

Data centres are traditionally huge buildings, packed full of powerful computers that carry out a large number of digital tasks in addition to driving AI, ranging from video streaming and online banking, to AI processing and data storage.

It's likely that anything you have an online login for uses a data centre somewhere in the world. Big companies own them, smaller ones lease capacity inside them.

Yet a few years ago I heard about a tiny data centre, the size of a washing machine, that was being operated in Devon, UK. In addition to its computing power, the heat it was releasing was warming a public swimming pool.

This was the first time I'd encountered a data centre that wasn't a giant warehouse, and I was initially very sceptical about the whole thing.</article>

<article> then I've heard of plenty of other examples. In November 2025, a British couple revealed they were heating their home via a small data centre housed in their garden shed.

A month later, I had dinner with a university professor who told me he had a GPU a powerful computer processor used to drive AI under his desk. And as it churned away, it was also keeping his office warm.

At the same time, the tech companies are investing billions of dollars in enormous data centre plants around the world. There are around 100 new ones underway in the UK alone. Data centres are energy hungry, and there are significant concerns about their environmental impact.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls data centres "AI factories". The argument in favour of them is that we need them to enable rapidly-evolving AI technology.</article>
